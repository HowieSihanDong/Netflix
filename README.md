## 📋 Overview

In this project, I applied multiple classifiers to:
- Analyze the impact of multiple parameters on classifier performance.
- Compare and evaluate various evaluation paradigms.
- Answer conceptual questions about **Naive Bayes**, **Decision Trees**, and baseline models based on observed results.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains:
- Detailed information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix.
- Copyright: CCO Public Domain 🌐
- Refer to the included README file in the `data/` folder for detailed feature descriptions.

### Sample Features:
- `Title` 📽️: Movie/TV show title
- `Director` 🎬: Director's name
- `Genre` 🎭: Genre of the content
- `Release Year` 📅: Year the content was released
- `Rating` ⭐: Netflix content rating (e.g., PG, R)
